I am a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam.


Currently mostly interested in AI interpretability of Large Language Models. For my Master's thesis, I investigated Knowledge Injection on Transformers for image captioning. Moreover, I am also intrigued by real-world applications of AI and robotics and recently finished a robotic quadrupled project (<a href="{{ '/projects/' | relative_url }}">see projects)</a>

I am passionate about state-of-the-art AI models and dissecting them to better understand and leverage their capabilities. My goal is to apply Artificial Intelligence to tackle the world's biggest problems.




<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
