I am a PhD student at the <a href='http://www.cltl.nl/'>Computational Linguistics and Text Mining Lab (CLTL)</a> at the <a href='https://vu.nl'>Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam</a>. My research is focused on Reinforcement Learning for Natural Language Processing and is part of the <a href='https://www.hybrid-intelligence-centre.nl/'>Hybrid Intelligence Center</a>.

My research interests lie in aligning AI models with human values to ensure their safety. For the same reason, I am interested in using Mechanistic Interpretability to improve our understanding of how Large Language Models work, thereby ensuring their safety and detecting failed cases of undesirable behavior.
My supervisors are [Antske Fokkens](http://wordpress.let.vupr.nl/antske/) and [Shihan Wang](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/SWang2).

Before starting my PhD, I obtained my Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Amsterdam, where I focused on Deep Learning. For my Master's thesis, I investigated Knowledge Injection on Transformers for image captioning. 
Afterward, I completed a semester in Physics at <a href="http://www.parisphysicsmaster.com/">Sorbonne Universit√©</a> as part of my Erasmus, building on the Physics courses I took as part of my bachelor's honors program. 
I am also passionate about applying AI to real-world problems. In the past, I have worked on a robotic quadruped project (<a href="{{ '/projects/' | relative_url }}">see projects)</a>.
